## 🧠 Problem

Users often feel lost after watching a psychologically rich movie like _Shutter Island_ or _Vanilla Sky_, unable to find thematically or emotionally similar content.

Netflix’s current engine lacks:
- Emotion-driven filters (e.g., “mind-bending”, “dreamlike”)
- Thematic search capabilities
- Post-watch intelligent suggestions based on tone and mood

---

## 💡 Proposed Feature

### 🔍 Search by Mood
A discovery experience where users can filter content using emotional states or themes.

### 🛠 How It Works
- Uses **AI/ML**, **NLP**, and **metadata tagging**
- Analyzes watch behavior, skips, likes/dislikes
- Matches emotional tone of previous content to make personalized recommendations

---

## 👤 Personas & Research
- Created detailed user personas representing emotional needs
- Identified engagement drop-off when relevant content isn’t found
- Proposed measurable KPIs to track success (retention, satisfaction)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Discussed
- **Machine Learning** for watch pattern recognition
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding movie scripts and reviews
- **Hybrid Recommendation Systems** combining collaborative + content-based filtering

---

## 📝 Outcome
